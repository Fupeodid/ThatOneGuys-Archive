basically u need python also u need to do theese things
install python
then install libpng, libjpeg-turbo, patches,ninja.
then do this in terminal
pip install UnityPy
wait until it finishes then make a random directory in downloads or wherever.
then download the .py and put it inside that directory.
also get a apk to put inside that directory bc it's needed
(take the data.unity3d out of the apk and put it inside the directory it's need for #1 and #2)
then run the python script. input a number 1 2 or 3 then wait
if u input 1 it saves every monoscript raw data to a folder In the same directory
if u input 2 it does the same thing aka saves to a folder
when u open the folder it has many text files that have the raw data of that script
if u input 3 it gets all the gameobjects and saves the active ones to a "ActiveGameObjects.txt" and same as the Inactive
also if there's multiple apks u input 1 or the number of the apk.
